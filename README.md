## Synopsis

This project is the first step in creating a platform for any content creator to protect their artwork by signing a Certificate of Authenticity and for buyers to verify authenticity of the artwork.

The intention is to use the MVP as a starting point for a company’s business model that’ll aim to influence the future of the art industry and potentially the content industry as a whole.

## Smart Contract

Certificates of Authenticity in our Dapp are the Smart Contracts and the tokens associated with them. The Smart Contract creates a token/tokens to represent ownership of a piece of artwork. These tokens can be exchanged for a denomination of Ethers which are publically traded.

The Smart Contract also contains descriptive information (Artist Name, Artwork Title, etc), as well as the cloud link to the the supporting material behind the artwork - critical evidence artists need to defend the authorship of their work.
